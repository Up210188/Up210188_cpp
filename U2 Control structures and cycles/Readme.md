 ## ***EXERCISE 1***

 ### Description:
 This program asks the user how much his annual income is and if it is less than 10,000 he pays 5% tax, if it is from 10,000 to 20,000 he pays 15%,  if the income is from 20,000 to 35,000 he pays 20%, if it is from 35,000 to 60,000 pay 30% and if it is more than 60,000 pay 45%.

 ### Data entry:
```c++
        //It asks the user for their annual income and saves it
        cout<<"What is your annual income in pesos? "; cin>>renta;
```

 ### Process:
  
  ```c++
        //Check that the user entered his income correctly
        if(renta<=0){
        cout<<"Please check the value of your rent well"<<endl;
        }

        //Check the income to see what percentage of tax corresponds
        else{
            if(renta<10000){
            porcentaje=5;
            }    
        
            else if(renta>=10000 && renta<20000){
            porcentaje=15;
            }

            else if(renta>=20000 && renta<35000){
            porcentaje=20;
            }

            else if(renta>=35000 && renta<60000){
            porcentaje=30;
            }    
            
            else if(renta>=60000){
            porcentaje=45;
            }

            //Prints the percentage and the value of the tax
            impositivo=renta*porcentaje/100;
            cout<<"Your tax is "<<porcentaje <<"%  and it will pay $"<<impositivo<<endl;
        }
  ```    
  ### Data output:
  ``` c++
        cout<<"Please check the value of your rent well"<<endl;
       
        cout<<"Your tax is "<<porcentaje <<"%  and it will pay $"<<impositivo<<endl;
  ```
### Explanation:
1.- first ask the user what his annual income is.

2.- Then check that the rent is correct and if it is incorrect it prints Error.

3.-Afterwards, with an if, compare the income to know which tax percentage corresponds to it.

4.- Then multiply the percentage by the rent and divide by 100.

5.- Finally, print the corresponding tax.
   ### Tests:
Case A: The user mistyped the rent.

## ***EXERCISE 2***
### Description:
In a certain company, its employees are evaluated at the end of each year.
The points that can be obtained in the evaluation start at 0.0 and can go up,
translating into better benefits. The points you can get
employees can be 0.0, 0.4, 0.6 or more, but not intermediate values
between the figures mentioned. Below is a table with the
levels corresponding to each score. The amount of money earned
on each level is $2,400 multiplied by the level score.

Level Score
Unacceptable 0.0
Acceptable 0.4
Merit 0.6 or more
Write a program that reads the user's score and indicates their level of performance,
as well as the amount of money the user will receive.
*Thank you very much for choosing us! We hope to serve you again.
 
### Data entry:
```c++
        //Ask the user for the employee's qualification
          cout<<"Enter the qualification of the worker: "; cin>>calificacion;
```

### Process:
  
  ```c++
        //Analyze the qualification to know what percentage of the bonus the employee will obtain
        if(calificacion==0.0||calificacion==0.4||calificacion>=0.6&&calificacion<=1){

            dineroConseguido= 2400*calificacion;
            porcentaje=calificacion*100;
            cout<<"Your bonus percentage is "<<porcentaje<<"% and your benefit is $"<<dineroConseguido<<endl;
        }

        //Check that the rating was correct
        else{
            cout<<"Please check your rating "<<endl;
        }
  ```    
### Data output:
  ``` c++
        cout<<"Your bonus percentage is "<<porcentaje<<"% and your benefit is $"<<dineroConseguido<<endl;
        cout<<"Please check your rating "<<endl;
  ```
### Explanation:
1.-First ask the qualification of the worker.

2.- Then, with an if, analyze that the rating is 0.0 or 0.4 or greater than 0.6 and less than 1.

3.- If the rating is incorrect, print Please check your rating.

4.- If the rating is correct, multiply the rating by 24000 and then multiply the rating by 100 to get the percentage.

5.- Finally, print the percentage and benefit.

### Tests:
Case A:The worker's rating is 0.

<img alt="2.1" height="40" src="../imagenes/2.1.png"/> 

Case B:The worker rating is 0.4.

<img alt="2.2" height="40" src="../imagenes/2.2.png"/> 


Case C:The worker's rating is greater than 0.6.

<img alt="2.3" height="40" src="../imagenes/2.3.png"/>

 ``` 


### Process:
  
  ```c++
        do{
            //ask the user the 6 temperatures
            cout<<"Give me the temperature: "; cin>>temperatura;
            temAcum += temperatura;
            contador++;
            //Compare to know the highest temperature
            if(temperatura>=temMayor){
                temMayor=temperatura;
            }
            //Compare to know the lower temperature
            else if(temperatura<=temMenor){
                temMenor=temperatura;
            }

        }while(contador< 6);
       
  ```    
### Data output:
  ``` c++
        //prints average temperatures
        cout<<"The average of temperature today is: "<< temAcum/6<<endl;
        //prints the highest temperature
        cout<<"The higher temperature is: "<<temMayor<<endl;
        //prints the lowest temperature
        cout<<"The lower temperature is: "<<temMenor<<endl;
        
  ```
### Explanation:
1.-First with a do-while cycle, it asks the user for the 6 temperatures.

2.-Within the cycle with if saves the highest and lowest temperature.

3.- Finally, the average of the 6 temperatures, the highest and the lowest temperature, is printed.

## ***EXERCISE 9***
### Description:
Write a program that solves a root by the bisection method.

### Data entry:

```c++ 
       //Ask the value of A
    cout<<"Give me the value of a: ";cin>>a;
    //Ask the value of B
    cout<<"Give me the value of b: ";cin>>b;
```

### Process:

```c++
    do
    {
        //Get the value of C
        c=(a+b)/2;
        ya=ResolverEcuacion(a);
        yb=ResolverEcuacion(b);
        yc=ResolverEcuacion(c);

        //prints the value of a, b, c, ya, yb, yc
         cout<< fixed <<setprecision(2)<<"|"<<a<<"\t|"<<b<<"\t|"<<c<<"\t|"<<ya<<"\t|"<<yb<<"\t|"<<yc<<"\t|"<<endl;
        
        //print the table
        for(int guion=0;guion<49;guion++){
            cout<<"-";
        }
        //verify that in the multiplication of ya and yc the sign changes
         cout<<endl;
        if(ya*yc<0){
            b=c;

        }
        //verify that in the multiplication of yb and yc the sign changes
        else if(yb*yc<0){
            a=c;
        }
        //prints that the root does not exist
        else{
            
            raiz=1;
            cout<<"The root does not exist in this interval"<<endl;
            break;
        }
       //the loop ends when yc is equal to the error 
    } while (abs(yc)>=error);
```

### Data output:

```c++

    cout<< fixed <<setprecision(2)<<"|"<<a<<"\t|"<<b<<"\t|"<<c<<"\t|"<<ya<<"\t|"<<yb<<"\t|"<<yc<<"\t|"<<endl;
    cout<<"The root does not exist in this interval"<<endl;
    cout<<"The root is: "<<c<<endl;

```
