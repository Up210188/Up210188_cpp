## ***DESCRIPTION***
In this unit we are going to work with some cycles such as: while, do while and for. We are also going to have to use creativity and intelligence to be able to develop a fast and efficient program.
 
 ## ***UNIT EXERCISES***

 ## ***EXERCISE 1***

 ### Description:
 This program asks the user how much his annual income is and if it is less than 10,000 he pays 5% tax, if it is from 10,000 to 20,000 he pays 15%,  if the income is from 20,000 to 35,000 he pays 20%, if it is from 35,000 to 60,000 pay 30% and if it is more than 60,000 pay 45%.
 ### Tax selection section:
  
  ```c++
        if(renta<10000){
            porcentaje=5;
        }    
        
        if(renta>=10000 && renta<20000){
            porcentaje=15;
        }

        if(renta>=20000 && renta<35000){
            porcentaje=20;
        }

        if(renta>=35000 && renta<60000){
            porcentaje=30;
        }    
            
         if(renta>=60000){
            porcentaje=45;
        }
  ```
