## ***EXECUTION AND USE***
To play you need to follow the following steps:
1.-Compile and run the program.
2.- Then select the game mode.
3.-If you chose the player mode, you only have to choose between the boxes from 1 to 9 and then the PC will start automatically.
4.-If you chose the multiplayer mode, the first player must choose the box between 1 and 9 and then the second player.
5.- The game ends until one of the players wins or the boxes are finished and that is considered a tie.


## ***General considerations***
1.-The game was developed in linux please use this operating system.
2.- When you select the game mode, type the number 1 to play alone and 2 for multiplayer, if you select another number it will repeat the question to select the game mode and if you type a letter you can bug.
3.- When playing with one player, the player starts with the character "X" and then the PC with the character "O".
4.- When playing multiplayer player 1 uses the character "X" and player 2 uses the character "O".
5.- When you are playing, only choose whole numbers from 1 to 9.
