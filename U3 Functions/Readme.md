## ***DESCRIPTION***
In this unit we learned about c++ functions such as function types, how to call a function, etc. To better understand the subject we play the tic tac toe game.

## ***EXECUTION AND USE***
To play you need to follow the following steps:

1.-Compile and run the program.

2.- Then select the game mode.

3.-If you chose the player mode, you only have to choose between the boxes from 1 to 9 and then the PC will start automatically.

4.-If you chose the multiplayer mode, the first player must choose the box between 1 and 9 and then the second player.

5.- The game ends until one of the players wins or the boxes are finished and that is considered a tie.


## ***GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS***
1.-The game was developed in linux please use this operating system.

2.- When you select the game mode, type the number 1 to play alone and 2 for multiplayer, if you select another number it will repeat the question to select the game mode and if you type a letter you can bug.

3.- When playing with one player, the player starts with the character "X" and then the PC with the character "O".

4.- When playing multiplayer player 1 uses the character "X" and player 2 uses the character "O".

5.- When you are playing, only choose whole numbers from 1 to 9.

## ***CONCLUSION***
This game was very entertaining because personally I don't have much programming skills and I had some difficulties such as: I didn't know how to debug, I didn't know where the error in my code was, etc. But thanks to my teacher and colleagues who They helped me, I was able to finish my program. The advantages I had with this program is to use functions to divide the program and find the error easier.
